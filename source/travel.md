## Hotel Accomodations

We've reserved a private 8-bunk room at [Wrigley Hostel][hostel], located just
two miles east of Hot Doug's and sporting a solid rating on various travel sites
(upwards of 4.5 out of 5!). The Sante Fe carpool group (see below) will occupy
five of these beds, which which leaves three vacancies for other WurstCon
attendees. If you're interesting in reserving a bunk, ping us in the
[Facebook group][facebook]!

## Road Trip

<img src="/images/roadtrip.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded">

That's right. In a remarkable vote of confidence for WurstCon, [Chuck Reeves]
has kindly volunteered to drive his Hyundai Santa Fe from New York to Chicago.
[Jeremy Mikola], [Daniel Cousineau], and [Phil Sturgeon] will be coming along
for the ride. Along the way, the group will stop over in Defiance, OH to pick up
[Chris Tankersley] for the last leg of the journey.

The Hyundai Santa Fe was awarded the Consumer Reports "top pick" in 2008.
Unfortunately, these gentlemen will be riding in a 2006 model.
