### Antwerp to Köln

If you&rsquo;re attending PHP Benelux before WurstCon, we&rsquo;d be delighted
to have you join our train convoy from Antwerp to Köln. [Jordi][seldaek] speaks
European and was kind enough to provide the following instructions:

 1. Open [this link][booking] to start the booking process.
 2. Scroll down to the 13:40 &rarr; 16.15 (IC / ICE) train, which has one change.
 3. Select the cheapest price (e.g. semi-flex for about €40)
 4. Deselect the seat reservation option. This will allow us the chance to sit
    as a group for the second leg between Brussels and Köln.
 5. Press "Confirm Selection" button to continue.

The confirmation screen should resemble the following:

The ticket you&rsquo;re purchasing will allow you to take any train to Brussels
from within Belgium, and at any time during the day. We will likely board an
earlier train in Antwerp at 13:17 to allow us some additional time to connect
to second leg between Brussels and Köln.

Proceed with payment and do *not* attempt to use **WURST** as a promotional code.

    <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-4x pull-left"></i> If you're under 26 years
    old, you may be able to get a cheaper ticket if you start the booking
    process from scratch; however, we don't have instructions for you.
    You&rsquo;re young, though. You can do it.
