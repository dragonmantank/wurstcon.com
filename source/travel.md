## Hotel Accomodations

The organizers have yet to suggest an official conference hotel. In the mean
time, feel free to discuss your travel plans in the [Facebook event][facebook]
or scout out some Chicago-area rentals on [Airbnb].

## Road Trip

That's right. In a remarkable vote of confidence for WurstCon, [Chuck Reeves]
has kindly volunteered to drive his Hyundai Santa Fe from New York to Chicago.
[Jeremy Mikola], [Daniel Cousineau], and [Phil Sturgeon] will be coming along
for the ride, which will leave [The League of Extraordinary Packages][phpleague]
with a bus factor of two for the duration of their journey.

The Hyundai Santa Fe was awarded the Consumer Reports "top pick" in 2008.
Unfortunately, these gentlemen will be riding in a 2005 model.
