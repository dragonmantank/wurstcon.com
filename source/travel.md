## Hotel Accomodations

### Köln

We suggest [Mercure Hotel Köln City Friesenstraße][mercure] for Sunday and
Monday. The hotel is located less than a block away from the karaoke bar we plan
to patronize on Sunday night, and offers a veritable smörgåsbord of amenities
limited only by the amount of money you're willing to spend.

## Planes, Trains, and Automobiles

### Antwerp to Köln

If you&rsquo;re attending PHP Benelux before WurstCon, we&rsquo;d be delighted
to have you join our train convoy from Antwerp to Köln. [Jordi][seldaek] speaks
European and was kind enough to provide the following instructions:

 1. Open [this link](http://goo.gl/GRNGDP) to start the booking process.
 2. Select the 13:40 &rarr; 16.15 (IC/ICE) train, which has one change.
 3. Select the cheapest price (e.g. semi-flex for about €40)
 4. Deselect the seat reservation option. This will allow everyone the chance to
    sit as a group.
 5. Press "Confirm Selection" button to continue.

The confirmation screen should resemble the following:

The ticket you&rsquo;re purchasing will allow you to take any train to Brussels
from within Belgium, and at any time during the day. We will likely board an
earlier train in Antwerp at 13:17 to allow us some additional time to connect
to second leg between Brussels and Köln.

Proceed with payment and do *not* attempt to use **WURST** as a promotional code.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span><span class="sr-only">Close</span></button>
    <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-4x pull-left"></i> If you're under 26 years
    old, you may be able to get a cheaper ticket if you start the booking
    process from scratch; however, we don't have instructions for you.
    You&rsquo;re young, though. You can do it.

### Köln to Amsterdam

If you&rsquo;re planning to head to Amsterdam after the main event on Sunday
(instead of sticking around for the Monday meetup in Köln), you may consider the
following itinerary:

 1. Open [this link](http://goo.gl/LcZWxW) to start the booking process.
 2. Select the 10:42 &rarr; 13:27 (ICE) train, which is direct.
 3. Select the cheapest price (e.g. semi-flex for about €20)
 4. Deselect the seat reservation option. This will allow everyone the chance to
    sit as a group.
 5. Press "Confirm Selection" button to continue.

The confirmation screen should resemble the following:

<img src="/images/train-koln_to_amsterdam.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded" style="border: 1px solid black">

Proceed with payment and don&rsquo;t even think about using **WURST** as a
promotional code.
