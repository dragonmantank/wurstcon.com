This website is published using [Sculpin], a delightful little static site
generator created by [Beau Simensen]. Although Beau actually had nothing to do
with this website, he did voluntarily retweet one of the original announcements
without even being asked. If your name is [Pascal Borreli] or you're in danger
of losing your commit streak on GitHub, feel free to submit a pull request to
the site's [source repository].

We also used [Bootstrap], [Google Fonts], and [Font Awesome] in a feeble attempt
to mask the fact that web design is not our forte; however, chances are very
likely that we're not fooling anybody.

Images used throughout the site are happily attributed to:

 * [Fred Arminsen](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0035488/) as the &ldquo;creepy Italian guy&rdquo; from [EuroTrip](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356150/)
 * Hot Dog icon by [Helen Tseng](http://www.thenounproject.com/chirp) from
   the [Noun Project](http://www.thenounproject.com)
