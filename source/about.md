This website is published using [Sculpin], a delightful little static site
generator created by [Beau Simensen]. Although Beau actually had nothing to do
with this website, he did voluntarily retweet one of the original announcements
without even being asked. If your name is [Pascal Borreli] or you're in danger
of losing your commit streak on GitHub, feel free to submit a pull request to
the site's [source repository].

We also used [Bootstrap] and [Google Fonts] in a feeble attempt to mask the fact
that web design is not our forte; however, chances are very likely that we're
not fooling anybody.

Images used throughout the site are happily attributed to:
