## Is This Really a Conference?

Yes! How many times do we have to plan elaborate trips to eat sausages before
people stop asking that question?

## Will There Be Talks?

Do you like metaphors? The sausage link that is WurstCon 2015 will be sandwiched
between a fresh, gluten-free bun of
<a href="https://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2015/">PHP Benelux</a> and
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/">FOSDEM</a>. Add a generous dose of meetup
condiments from all over Germany and you&rsquo;re left to relish ten days of
dense, meaty conference goodness.

Yes, there will be talks.

## Who's Behind This?

Back in September 2014, [Jeremy Mikola][jmikola] promised a dozen jealous
Europeans that WurstCon would one day come to their side of the Atlantic.
[Anthony Ferrara][ircmaxell] then attempted to back this idea on Kickstarter,
but gave up after becoming distracted by yet another elePHPant fundraiser.

Thankfully, a Texan by the name of [Daniel Cousineau][dcousineau], who history
buffs will immediately recognize as a WurstCon 2014 veteran, hopped aboard and
the wheels were set in motion. As [more][coderabbi] [and][dshafik]
[more][e3betht] [folks][seldaek] signed on, it soon became apparent that
WurstCon 2015 would have [no shortage of cooks][cooks].
