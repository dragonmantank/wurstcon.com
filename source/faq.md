## Is This Really a Conference?

Yes and no. There may be talks, but there won't be a call for papers. There may
be a hallway track, but there won't be a hallway. We won't have mustard-colored
elePHPants to hand out as door prizes, and we probably won't have sponsors, but
the food is going to be terrific and an after-party is in the cards.

In the interest of maintaining appearances and an air of professionalism, we may
schedule the following:

 * Evening hackathon, focusing on projects such as [MarcWWurstBundle][bundle].
   The bundle may already have [hot dog support][bundle-pr], but there is plenty
   of room for new meat products.
 * Wurst-themed presentations, such as
   [Inside the Sausage Factory: A Journey from PHP to C][php-c]. In fact, we
   might just make that the opening keynote for lack of a better option.
 * Free-range birds of a feather sessions on a variety of topics. Poultry is a
   wonderful option for those wurst aficionados that want to keep fit.
 * Lightning talk(s) that will test your brain's ability to absorb information
   of dubious value at record pace.

## Who's Behind This?

[Jeremy Mikola][jmikola] and [Matt Frost][shrtwhitebldguy] are definitely
involved. [Chris Hartjes][grmpyprogrammer] was thinking about it, but he
ultimately decided that family was more important and will be abstaining.
Thankfully, [Sammy Kaye Powers][SammyK], a Chicago native, has thrown his
support behind the project. [Zack Kitzmiller][zackkitzmiller] also expressed
interest in attending, but then he [raised $35 million][seatgeek] and decided
that he was too cool for school.

## And Where, Exactly?

[Hot Doug's][hotdougs], which is located in the Avondale suburb of Chicago, IL.
Details on the venue may be found on its website, as well as
[Foursquare][hotdougs-foursquare] and [Yelp][hotdougs-yelp].

Very soon, we hope to update this space with details on accomodations for the
weekend. If enough non-locals are attending, we may look into renting a
multi-bedroom unit on AirBnb for the weekend. At the very least, we'll settle on
a suggested hotel to keep everyone close by for other events during the
conference.
