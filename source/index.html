                <h1>WurstCon 2014</h1>
                <p>Tentatively slated for <strong>September 20</strong>, this aims to be <em>the</em> wurst conference of 2014. We&rsquo;re gathering the best and brightest of the dimwitted PHP community together under <em>no</em> roof to wait in line for several hours on a brisk autumn Saturday in Chicago with the hope of sampling some of the finest grilled, tubular meat products available within the continental United States.</p>
                <p>Come October 4, <a href="http://www.hotdougs.com/">Hot Doug&rsquo;s</a> will be on permanent vacation, so the clock is ticking. Most of us also have real conferences to attend later in the year, so this is really the ideal time for such an excursion.</p>

        <h2>Is This Really a Conference?</h2>

        <p>Yes and no. There may be talks, but there won&rsquo;t be a call for papers. There may be a hallway track, but there won&rsquo;t be a hallway. We won&rsquo;t have mustard-colored elePHPants to hand out as door prizes, and we probably won&rsquo;t have sponsors, but the food is going to be terrific and an after-party is in the cards.</p>

        <p>In the interest of maintaining appearances and an air of professionalism, we may schedule the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Evening hackathon, focusing on projects such as <a href="https://github.com/marcw/MarcWWurstBundle">MarcWWurstBundle</a>. The bundle may already have <a href="https://github.com/marcw/MarcWWurstBundle/pull/3">hot dog support</a>, but there is plenty of room for new meat products.</li>
            <li>Wurst-themed presentations, such as <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jmikola/inside-the-sausage-factory-a-journey-from-php-to-c">Inside the Sausage Factory: A Journey from PHP to C</a>. In fact, we might just make that the opening keynote for lack of a better option.</li>
            <li>Free-range birds of a feather sessions on a variety of topics. Poultry is a wonderful option for those wurst aficionados that want to keep fit.</li>
            <li>Lightning talk(s) that will test your brain's ability to absorb information of dubious value at record pace.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who&rsquo;s Behind This?</h2>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-7">
                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jmikola/status/500081588365828098">Jeremy Mikola</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/shrtwhitebldguy/status/500082621242945538">Matt Frost</a> are definitely involved. <a href="https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer/status/500097498128867329">Chris Hartjes</a> was thinking about it, but he ultimately decided that family was more important and will be abstaining. Thankfully, <a href="https://twitter.com/SammyK/status/500099713732186112">Sammy Kaye Powers</a>, a Chicago native, has thrown his support behind the project. <a href="https://twitter.com/zackkitzmiller/status/500089084384382976">Zack Kitzmiller</a>, stalwart pragmatist that he is, has also expressed interest in attending.</p>

        <h2>And Where, Exactly?</h2>

                <p><a href="http://www.hotdougs.com/">Hot Doug&rsquo;s</a>, which is located in the Avondale suburb of Chicago, IL. Details on the venue may be found on its website, as well as <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/hot-dougs/4676f5baf964a520e1471fe3">Foursquare</a> and <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-dougs-chicago">Yelp</a>.</p>

                <p>Very soon, we hope to update this space with details on accomodations for the weekend. If enough non-locals are attending, we may look into renting a multi-bedroom unit on AirBnb for the weekend. At the very least, we&rsquo;ll settle on a suggested hotel to keep everyone close by for other events during the conference.</p>
